Tests for the [Files and Directory Entries API](https://github.com/wicg/entries-api)

* [Explainer](https://github.com/WICG/entries-api/blob/gh-pages/EXPLAINER.md)
* [Draft Specification](https://wicg.github.io/entries-api/)

Unfortunately, most of the tests are **manual** and require drag-and-drop of test data.
They can be run via [w3c-test.org](http://w3c-test.org/entries-api/), but a local
clone of the repo is required for access to the `entries-api/support` files.
