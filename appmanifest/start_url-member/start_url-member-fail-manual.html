<h1>Cross-origin start URLs are invalid</h1>
<script>
  // Force the port of the origin to be :8444
  // we treat port :8443 to be another origin that we fail against
  if (window.location.origin !== "https://web-platform.test:8444") {
    window.location = new URL(window.location.pathname, "https://web-platform.test:8444")
  }
</script>

<style>
@media all and (display-mode: fullscreen) {
  body {
    background-color: green;
  }
}
</style>

<p>
  To pass, the start URL must not be fail.html because it's not same origin.
  It will use this page as the start URL and the background will be green.
