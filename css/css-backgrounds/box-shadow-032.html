  Issue 811083: Incorrect parsing of box-shadow: color inset {2 lengths}
  https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=811083
  -->
<meta content="" name="flags"><!--

  <shadow> = inset? && <length>{2,4} && <color>?

  A comma-separated pair of numbers in curly braces {A,B}
  indicates that the preceding type, word, or group occurs
  at least A and at most B times.

  A question mark (?) indicates that the preceding type,
  word, or group is optional (occurs zero or one times).

  The components of each <shadow> are interpreted as follows:

  1st <length>
    Specifies the horizontal offset
    of the shadow. A positive value draws a shadow that is offset to the right of the box, a negative length to the left.
  2nd <length>
    Specifies the vertical offset
    of the shadow. A positive value offsets the shadow down, a negative one up.
  4th <length>
    Specifies the spread distance. Positive values cause the shadow to expand in all directions by the specified radius. Negative values cause the shadow to contract.
  inset
    If present, the inset keyword changes the drop shadow from an outer box-shadow (one that shadows the box onto the canvas, as if it were lifted above the canvas) to an inner box-shadow (one that shadows the canvas onto the box, as if the box were cut out of the canvas and shifted behind it).
