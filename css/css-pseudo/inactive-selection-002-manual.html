    {
      border: black solid medium;
      padding: 20px;
      width: 520px;
    }
  </style>

  <p>Instructions: select a few (or all) characters from the red words "Select This Text". Select them with mouse dragging (leftwardedly or rightwardedly) or text-highlighting them with <kbd>Shift</kbd> and keyboard arrows when keyboard navigation (also called caret browsing) is enabled.

  <p>Reminder: you can select a whole word by double-clicking on it. You can select a whole line by triple-clicking anywhere inside it.

  <p>Test passes if the red glyphs of "Select This Text" become purple on a yellow background color when selecting them and then if such selected purple <strong>glyphs become green</strong> with still a yellow background color when the focus switches outside the black-bordered rectangle.

  <div><object data="support/embedded-doc-inactive-selection-001.html" type="text/html">This test requires a browser with capability to embed an HTML document thanks to the HTML &lt;object&gt; element.</object></div>
