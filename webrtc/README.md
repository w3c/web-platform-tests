Some data channel tests are based on the [data channel conformance test
suite][nplab-webrtc-dc-playground] of the Network Programming Lab of the Münster
University of Applied Sciences. We would like to thank Peter Titz, Felix Weinrank and Timo
Völker for allowing us to make their test cases available under the W3C license.
