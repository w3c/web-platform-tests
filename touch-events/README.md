This directory contains the test files for the Touch Events v1 spec. 

A W3C Recommendation for this spec was published 2013-Oct-10: <http://www.w3.org/TR/2013/REC-touch-events-20131010/>. The Web Events Working Group created this spec and the spec's Implementation Report <http://www.w3.org/2010/webevents/wiki/TEv1ImplReport>. That group was closed in November 2013 and no further work is planned for this specification.
