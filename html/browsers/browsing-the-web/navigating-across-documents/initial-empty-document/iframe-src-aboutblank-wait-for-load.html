/*
  When an iframe is created it will contain the initial empty document. However,
  when the iframe's src is set to "about:blank", it will trigger a navigation to
  a non-initial about:blank document, which will replace the initial empty
  document.
  These tests verify the behavior of navigations that happen after the
  non-initial about:blank document finished loading. These navigations should
  not be auto-converted to do replacement like they would if they start on the
  initial empty document.
