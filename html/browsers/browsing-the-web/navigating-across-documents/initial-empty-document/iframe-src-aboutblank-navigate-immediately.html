/*
  When an iframe is created it will contain the initial empty document. However,
  when the iframe's src is set to "about:blank", it will trigger a navigation to
  a non-initial about:blank document, which will replace the initial empty
  document.
  These tests verify the behavior of navigations that happem immediately after
  the iframe is created, when the non-initial about:blank navigation just
  started. Since the non-initial about:blank navigation shouldn't have
  committed yet, the iframe should still be on the initial empty document, so
  navigations that start at that timing should do replacement.
