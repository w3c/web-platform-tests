  <!-- TODO:
  askalski: while this test pass, it does not test anything now.
  It should test, whether with no document.charset set in any way, the
  external scripts will get decoded using utf-8 as fallback character encoding.
  It seems like utf-8 is also a fallback encoding to html (my guess), so
  the part of the code I was attempting to test is never reached.
