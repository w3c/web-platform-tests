<p><strong>Note:</strong> Before running this test, delete all registered
custom handlers and restart your browser.

<ol>
 <li>A dialog should appear on this page. Approve it.
 <li><a href='sms:foo'>Then click this link.</a>
 <li>A new dialog should appear. Approve it and have it
 remember your selection, if possible.
 <li>The handler will attempt to put the browser into an infinite request
 loop. Even if it does end up in a loop, the browser should not become
 unusable, and should allow you to recover, such as by loading a new URL
 or closing the tab.
</ol>
