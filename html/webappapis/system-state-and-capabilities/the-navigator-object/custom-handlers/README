This is a test suite for the custom scheme and content handlers
described in the HTML5 specification:

  http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/timers.html#custom-handlers

The following two functions are tested:

  navigator.registerProtocolHandler(scheme, url, title);
  navigator.registerContentHandler(mimeType, url, title);

The test suite is structured as follows:

  evil/
    Contains tests demonstrating methods malicious authors
    may use to cause trouble for users. The tests have no
    definite pass conditions, but browsers should not crash
    or become unusable when said tests are loaded.

  interactive/
    Contains tests requiring some sort of human interaction.
    These tests are automated using the Watir test framework.
    Automation scripts reside in the interactive/watir/
    directory. Helper files reside in the interactive/res/
    directory.

  js/
    Contains tests automated with JavaScript.
