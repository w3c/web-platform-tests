// This test tests for the nonexistence of a reload override buffer, which is
// used in a previous version of the HTML Standard to make reloads of a
// document.open()'d document load the written-to document rather than doing an
// actual reload of the URL.
//
// This test has a somewhat interesting structure compared to the other tests
// in this directory. It eschews the <iframe> structure used by other tests,
// since when the child frame is reloaded it should adopt the URL of the test
// page (the responsible document of the entry settings object), and the spec
// forbids navigation in nested browsing contexts to the same URL as their
// parent. To work around that, we use window.open() which does not suffer from
// that restriction.
